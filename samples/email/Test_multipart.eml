Hello friend,

My name is Miss Ammaarah Younis from Libya. I am the only surviving child of Late Colonel Abu Bakr Younis, Libya's former defence minister killed with Late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Sirte, Libya.

I am writing from Libya and I have business proposal worth $60M  U.S.D which I will like you to help me claim and Invest in Your country. Presently due to the war here, i can not travel out to go and claim the money and Invest it where it is deposited in offshore country. I will like you to kindly write me at my private email (yyounisammaarah2015@gmail.com) so that I can tell you in details what you are expected to do for me and also for me to send you documents proof of the funds. I am ready to give you half of the money for your help. This will not waste your time.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Ammaarah Younis..

You may not know me and you are probably wondering why you are getting this e mail, right?

I'm a hacker who cracked your email and devices a few months ago.

Do not try to contact me or find me, it is impossible, since I sent you an email from YOUR hacked account.

I setup a malware on the adult vids (porno) web-site and guess what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what I mean).

While you were watching videos, your internet browser started out functioning as a RDP (Remote Control) having a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your screen and web cam.

after that, my software program obtained all of your contacts from your Phone, Messenger and email.

You entered a passwords on the websites you visited, and I intercepted it.

Of course you can will change it, or already changed it.

But it doesn't matter, my malware updated it every time.

What did I do?

I backuped phone. All photo, video and contacts.

I created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste haha . . .), and 2nd part shows the recording of your web cam.

exactly what should you do?

Well, in my opinion, $1000 (USD) is a fair price for our little secret. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search "how to buy bitcoin" in Google).

My Bitcoin wallet Address:

1KhDTLk95fZQBd5tUXj4123459bBAji2DB

(It is cAsE sensitive, so copy and paste it)

Important:

You have 48 hour in order to make the payment. (I've a unique pixel in this e mail, and at this moment I know that you have read through this email message).

To track the reading of a message and the actions in it, I use the facebook pixel.

Thanks to them. (Everything that is used for the authorities can help us.)

More you can find out by the link.


If I do not get the BitCoins, I will certainly send out your video recording to all of your contacts including relatives, coworkers, and so on. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the video immidiately. If you need evidence, reply with "Yes!" and I will certainly send out your video recording to your 6 contacts. It is a non-negotiable offer, that being said don't waste my personal time and yours by responding to this message.
